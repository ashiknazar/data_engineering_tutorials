    "# Why Non-Linear Activation Functions Enable Learning in Neural Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks rely on **activation functions** to introduce non-linearity into the model, enabling them to learn complex patterns. Here’s why **non-linear activation functions** are essential for learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Linear Activation Functions**\n",
    "- A linear activation function, such as \\( f(x) = x \\), applies a simple linear transformation.\n",
    "- When only linear activation functions are used, the entire network behaves as a single linear model, no matter how many layers it has.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "For a network with weights \\( W_1 \\), \\( W_2 \\), and \\( W_3 \\):\n",
    "$f(x) = W_3(W_2(W_1x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "If $f(x)$ is linear, this simplifies to:\n",
    "$f(x) = W_{\\text{combined}}x, \\quad \\text{where } W_{\\text{combined}} = W_3 \\cdot W_2 \\cdot W_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means the network cannot model complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **Non-Linear Activation Functions**\n",
    "Non-linear activation functions (e.g., **ReLU**, **sigmoid**, **tanh**) introduce non-linearity, allowing the network to:\n",
    "- Learn **complex, non-linear mappings** from input to output.\n",
    "- Create **curved decision boundaries** needed for solving non-linearly separable problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Universal Approximation Theorem:\n",
    "A neural network with at least one hidden layer and a **non-linear activation function** can approximate any continuous function, given sufficient neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Role in Backpropagation**\n",
    "Non-linear activation functions enable:\n",
    "- **Rich gradient flow**: Non-linearity ensures meaningful gradients during backpropagation, so weights adjust to capture complex patterns.\n",
    "- **Hierarchical feature learning**: Each layer transforms inputs non-linearly, allowing the network to build progressively abstract features.\n",

    "1. Enable neural networks to model complex, non-linear relationships.\n",
